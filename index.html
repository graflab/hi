    <h1><u><b>Welcome to Violet Graf.<b></u></h1>
    <p>
        We are a technology company based in Canada.  <p></p>
        Operating from first principles, we are proudly making our own unique contribution toward a brand new, better internet. <p></p> 
        Our team builds upon a novel identity protocol called <span class="highlight">Violet Core</span>, which leverages cryptographic proofs and any number of a myriad blockchains to ensure privacy and security of data that is important to humans.<p></p>
 

<p></p>
 <b>Our base protocol is not limited to written documents or any other specific file type.</b> Violet Core IDs (<i>VIDs</i>) can represent any unit of information, allowing for use across <b>unlimited industries and applications.</b>
    <p></p>

    <!-- <h2>Introducing Violet Core</h2>
    <p>
        Violet Core is our in-house identity protocol, designed to enable secure, tamper-proof file signing and identity verification. Built on the foundation of advanced cryptography and blockchain technology, Violet Core ensures that every digital signature is stored immutably, giving users and organizations confidence in the authenticity of their files.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our protocol works by generating unique Violet IDs (VIDs) through a robust hashing algorithm. Each VID is linked to a specific file and recorded on the <span class="highlight">Cardano blockchain</span>, a decentralized platform renowned for its <span class="highlight">security, scalability, and zero downtime</span>.
    </p> -->

    <h1><u><b>Unlimited use cases across industries and applications</b></u></h1>
    <p>
        Violet Core is adaptable to various industries including (but not limited) to:
    </p>
<ul>
    <li><u>Healthcare:</u> Ensure the integrity of patient records, medical imaging, and lab results by anchoring them to an immutable ledger.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li><u>Legal:</u> Securely sign and verify contracts, legal filings, and notarized documents without relying on third parties.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li><u>Education:</u> Issue verifiable certificates, diplomas, and transcripts that employers and institutions can instantly confirm.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li><u>Supply Chain:</u> Track and verify the authenticity of shipments, parts, and materials with auditable proof at each checkpoint.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li><u>Financial Services:</u> Securely verify financial reports, audits, and tax documents to meet regulatory compliance with confidence.</li>
</ul>
